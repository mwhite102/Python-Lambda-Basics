# Lamdas Basics in Python

## What are Lamdas?

Lamdas are Python's implementation of anonymous functions.

## Basic Syntax

```Python
lambda arguments: expression
```

The literal "lambda" keyword begins a lambda function.

Arguments are comma-separated list of input parameters of the function.

Expression is a single expression whose result is implicitly returned.

## Examples

## When to Use Lambdas?

Lambdas can be used when a small, one-time function is needed.  They are very useful where functions can be accepted as parameters to other functions.
